## Project Overview
This repository provides scripts for running YOLOv8-based face and object detection on images and videos. The main scripts, `object.py` and `yolo_face.py`, detects objects and faces using a YOLOv8n model and its retrained model and outputs annotated images or videos with bounding boxes and confidence scores, respectively. This introduces the newcomer to various ML concepts.

### Preparation

```bash
# Raspberry Pi OS â€” 3-liner, no venv: install Python tooling, cv2, Ultralytics YOLO, Requests, and make ~/.local/bin permanent
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip build-essential libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libatlas-base-dev libopenblas-dev
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user pip && pip install --user opencv-python ultralytics requests        # cv2 & yolo CLI go to ~/.local/bin
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && exec "$SHELL" -l                                # add to .bashrc and reload shell
```

## Model Weights

Download the YOLOv8 face detector weights from the official repository:
- [lindevs/yolov8-face](https://github.com/lindevs/yolov8-face)

Place the downloaded weights file (e.g., `yolov8n-face-lindevs.pt`) in the project root directory.

## Usage

### Face Detection on Images

```bash
python yolo_face.py --source bus.jpg --output bus_face.jpg
```
- Input: `bus.jpg` (or any image file)
- Output: `bus_face.jpg` (annotated image with bounding boxes and confidence values)

### Face Detection on Videos

```bash
python yolo_face.py --source path/to/video.mp4 --output path/to/output.mp4
```
- Input: Any video file
- Output: Annotated video with detected faces
